Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification
# Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification

## Overview
This project aims to solve the Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification problem from a Kaggle competition hosted by Jigsaw and Google's Conversation AI team. The objective of the challenge is to build machine learning models that can detect toxicity in online conversations while minimizing unintended bias, particularly with regard to identity terms.

## Competition Description
The challenge in this competition is to build a model that:
- Recognizes toxicity in comments.
- Minimizes unintended bias, particularly with respect to identity mentions.


## Key Concepts
- **Toxicity Detection**: The task of identifying comments that are rude, harmful, or disrespectful, which can make people leave online conversations.
- **Unintended Bias**: Bias that occurs when a model incorrectly associates certain words or phrases (especially identity terms) with toxicity, even when those phrases are used in a non-offensive context.
- **Identity Mentions**: Comments containing references to certain identities (e.g., race, gender, sexual orientation) are flagged in the dataset to ensure that the model does not associate these terms with toxicity unjustly.

## Solution Overview
The project focuses on developing a model that:
- Accurately identifies toxic comments.
- Reduces unintended bias by balancing the modelâ€™s predictions with respect to identity terms.

## Model Development
To tackle this problem, several techniques were employed, including:
- **Text Preprocessing**: Cleaning the text to remove noise (e.g., special characters, HTML tags) while preserving important context.
- **Embeddings**: Using pre-trained word embeddings to represent comments in a format suitable for model input.
- **Bias Reduction Strategies**: Employing techniques such as re-weighting, adversarial training, and fairness-aware regularization to ensure the model does not unjustly associate identity terms with toxicity.
- **Evaluation Metric Optimization**: The model was trained and optimized to perform well according to the competition's custom metric, which balances accuracy and fairness.

## Dataset
The dataset contains comments labeled with:
- **Toxicity**: Whether the comment is toxic or non-toxic.
- **Identity Labels**: Whether the comment mentions identities such as gender, sexual orientation, race, etc.

### Dataset Source
The dataset can be found on Kaggle under the competition name: Jigsaw Unintended Bias in Toxicity Classification.

### Features
- **Text**: The raw comment text.
- **Toxicity Labels**: A binary label (0 or 1) indicating whether the comment is toxic.
- **Identity Labels**: Binary flags for various identity categories (e.g., "male," "female," "gay").

## Model Performance
The model is evaluated using a custom metric designed to balance toxicity detection with bias reduction. This metric takes into account:
- **Standard Accuracy**: How well the model detects toxic comments.
- **Bias Metrics**: How well the model avoids unintended bias with respect to identity terms.

## Conclusion
This project addresses the challenge of building fair and accurate models for toxicity detection in online comments. By minimizing unintended bias while maintaining high performance in toxicity classification, the solution helps foster safer, more inclusive online conversations.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Set up Kaggle API to download the dataset.
3. Preprocess the dataset and train the model using the provided scripts.
4. Evaluate the model using the custom competition metric to measure both accuracy and bias reduction.
